### Data Architecture Overview for Financial Planning Application

#### 1. **Core Data Layers**
These layers represent the primary data entities and their interactions within the system.

1.1 **Transactional Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Store and manage all financial transactions, including income, expenses, and transfers.
     - Provide raw data for calculating balances and analyzing cash flows.
   - **Components:**
     - Records of actual transactions (date, amount, type, category).
     - Links to associated plans or budgets.
   - **Interaction:**
     - Feeds data to the analytical layer for reporting and forecasting.

1.2 **Planning Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Define and manage budgets, goals, and resource allocations.
   - **Components:**
     - Plan structures (e.g., savings funds, spending targets, mixed plans).
     - Group plans for hierarchical goals (e.g., high-level projects with subcategories).
   - **Interaction:**
     - Receives updates from transactional data and supports forecast modeling.

1.3 **Action Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Track manual interventions, such as fund transfers or adjustments.
   - **Components:**
     - Logs of user actions (e.g., manual adjustments, plan edits).
     - Records for tracking and audit trails.
   - **Interaction:**
     - Provides metadata for evaluating user-driven changes and their impacts on forecasts.

#### 2. **Supportive Layers**
These layers enhance functionality and improve user experience.

2.1 **Settings Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Manage user-defined configurations for rules, categories, and notifications.
   - **Components:**
     - Rules for automatic income allocation.
     - Preferences for notifications and reminders.
     - User-defined spending categories.
   - **Interaction:**
     - Directs behaviors in the transactional and planning layers.

2.2 **Calendar and Events Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Maintain a timeline of financial activities and forecasts.
   - **Components:**
     - Records of scheduled payments, expected incomes, and reminders.
     - Historical logs for comparison against forecasts.
   - **Interaction:**
     - Supports reporting and ensures synchronization with user goals.

2.3 **Wallets Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Reflect real-world cash holdings and their alignment with system data.
   - **Components:**
     - Balances for different storage types (e.g., cash, bank accounts).
     - Reconciliation records between calculated and actual balances.
   - **Interaction:**
     - Feeds discrepancies into the analytical layer for resolution.

#### 3. **Analytical and Reporting Layers**
These layers transform raw and processed data into actionable insights.

3.1 **Forecasting Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Provide future projections based on current and historical data.
   - **Components:**
     - Models for predicting income, expenses, and balances.
     - Scenario analyses (e.g., optimistic, realistic, pessimistic).
   - **Interaction:**
     - Draws data from transactional and planning layers to produce forward-looking reports.

3.2 **Reporting Layer**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Generate visualizations and summaries for user review.
   - **Components:**
     - Predefined and custom reports (e.g., spending analysis, goal progress).
     - Dashboards for real-time updates.
   - **Interaction:**
     - Aggregates data from all layers to provide comprehensive insights.

#### 4. **Inter-layer Dependencies**
The layers interact in structured workflows:
   - **Data Flow:**
     - Transactions update plans, which in turn update forecasts.
     - Actions adjust transactional or planning data, triggering recalculations.
   - **Feedback Loops:**
     - Analytical outputs (e.g., unrealistic plan warnings) inform user actions.
     - Reconciliations in the wallets layer ensure data accuracy.

#### 5. **Key Architectural Considerations**
- **Scalability:**
  - Layers should support additional data points (e.g., new plan types, custom categories) without reworking core logic.
- **Consistency:**
  - Ensure all updates to one layer (e.g., new transaction) are synchronized across dependent layers.
- **Flexibility:**
  - Allow users to configure rules, goals, and categories dynamically.
- **Auditability:**
  - Maintain logs and histories for all data points to support reviews and debugging.

### Conclusion
This layered architecture ensures comprehensive data organization, supporting complex financial management and analytics. It balances flexibility with structure, providing a robust foundation for both current functionalities and future enhancements.
